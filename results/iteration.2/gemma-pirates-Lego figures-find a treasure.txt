Q: Suggest a scenario to play with the Cubetto tangible programming toy for pre-school children. It should be about pirates, involve Lego figures and children should use Cubetto to find a treasure.

A:
##  Ahoy, Mateys! Treasure Hunt with Cubetto!

**Scenario:**

Captain Blackheart has hidden his treasure chest somewhere on the pirate island!  You and your crew (Lego pirate figures) need to use Cubetto to find it!

**Materials:**

* Cubetto robot
* Cubetto board
* Lego pirate figures
* Lego blocks to build a simple island landscape (optional)
* Treasure chest (can be a small box or a Lego creation)

**Instructions:**

1. **Set the Stage:**

   * Build a simple island landscape with Lego blocks, or use a flat surface as your island.
   * Place the treasure chest somewhere hidden on the island.
   * Introduce the Lego pirate figures and explain they are your crew.

2. **The Mission:**

   * Tell the children Captain Blackheart has hidden his treasure chest somewhere on the island.
   * Explain that Cubetto is their trusty robot navigator and they need to program him to find the treasure.

3. **Programming Cubetto:**

   * Show the children how to use the Cubetto blocks to program simple movements: forward, backward, turn left, turn right.
   * Encourage them to experiment and try different combinations of blocks to move Cubetto around the island.

4. **The Treasure Hunt:**

   * Let the children program Cubetto to explore the island.
   * Guide them to think about the best path to take to find the treasure.
   * Encourage them to use their pirate figures to "search" along the way.

5. **Victory!**

   * When Cubetto reaches the treasure chest, celebrate!
   * Let the children open the treasure chest and reveal the hidden treasure (can be small toys, stickers, or even a pirate flag).

**Variations:**

* **Obstacles:** Add Lego obstacles to the island, like rocks or a pirate ship, to make the treasure hunt more challenging.
* **Clues:** Hide clues around the island that the children need to find before they can program Cubetto to the treasure.
* **Multiple Treasures:** Hide multiple treasure chests with different treasures inside.


This scenario allows children to learn about programming concepts in a fun and engaging way while also developing
