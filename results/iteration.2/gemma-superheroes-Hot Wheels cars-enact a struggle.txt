Q: Suggest a scenario to play with the Cubetto tangible programming toy for pre-school children. It should be about superheroes, involve Hot Wheels cars and children should use Cubetto to enact a struggle.

A:
## Superhero Rescue Mission!

**Scenario:**

The city is in danger! A villain (represented by a Hot Wheels car) has stolen a precious artifact (a small toy, like a block or a figurine) and is speeding away!  Our superhero (another Hot Wheels car) needs to catch the villain and save the day!

**Materials:**

* Cubetto robot
* Cubetto blocks
* Two Hot Wheels cars (one for the superhero, one for the villain)
* A small toy representing the stolen artifact
* A playmat or large sheet of paper to represent the city

**Instructions:**

1. **Set the scene:**  Lay out the playmat and position the "city" with buildings and obstacles. Place the villain's car at one end with the stolen artifact.

2. **Introduce the characters:** Explain to the children that the villain is trying to escape with the artifact and the superhero needs to stop them!

3. **Program the superhero:**  Using Cubetto blocks, guide the children to program the superhero car to:

    * **Move forward:**  Program the superhero to drive towards the villain.
    * **Turn:**  Program the superhero to turn around obstacles or change direction if needed.
    * **Pick up the artifact:**  If possible, program the superhero to "pick up" the artifact using a block or a claw attachment (if available).

4. **Play the rescue mission:** Let the children watch as the superhero car follows their program and tries to catch the villain.

5. **Adapt and improvise:** Encourage the children to change the program and try different strategies. Maybe the superhero needs to go faster, or maybe they need to take a different route.

**Variations:**

* **Add more obstacles:** Use blocks or toys to create a more challenging course for the superhero.
* **Introduce other characters:** Add more Hot Wheels cars to represent other superheroes or villains.
* **Tell a story:** Encourage the children to create a story around the rescue mission, adding details about the villain's plan and the superhero's heroic actions.


This scenario allows children to explore basic programming concepts while engaging in imaginative play. It also encourages problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration.
