A:
Here's a scenario to play with Cubetto:

**Title:** "Barbie's Wild West Rescue"

**Story:** In the Wild West town of "Cactus Junction," a notorious outlaw named "Blackheart Bill" has kidnapped the town's beloved sheriff, played by a Barbie doll. The sheriff's trusty sidekick, also a Barbie doll, has sent out a distress call to all the brave cowboys and cowgirls in the area. It's up to the children to use Cubetto to create a rescue mission and save the sheriff.

**Objective:** The children will use Cubetto to program a path for a brave cowboy (played by a child) to navigate through the Wild West town, avoiding obstacles and reaching the sheriff's prison cell to rescue her.

**Setup:**

1. Create a Wild West town setting using blocks, cardboard boxes, or other materials. Include a main street, a saloon, a sheriff's office, and a prison cell.
2. Place the Barbie doll sheriff in the prison cell and the Barbie doll sidekick in the sheriff's office.
3. Set up obstacles such as rocks, cacti, and bandits (played by other Barbie dolls) along the path to the prison cell.
4. Introduce the Cubetto toy and explain its basic functions (e.g., moving forward, turning left or right, and stopping).

**Gameplay:**

1. The children will take turns using Cubetto to program a path for the brave cowboy to follow.
2. Each child will create a sequence of steps using Cubetto's blocks, such as:
	* Move forward 3 blocks
	* Turn left
	* Stop
	* Move forward 2 blocks
	* Turn right
3. The child will then use the Cubetto to execute the program, and the brave cowboy will follow the path.
4. If the cowboy encounters an obstacle, the child will need to adjust the program to navigate around it.
5. The goal is to reach the prison cell and rescue the sheriff without getting caught by Blackheart Bill's bandits.

**Variations:**

* To add an extra challenge, introduce "weather"
