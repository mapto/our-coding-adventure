Q: Suggest a scenario to play with the Cubetto tangible programming toy for pre-school children. It should be about knights and princesses, involve Barbie dolls and children should use Cubetto to enact a pursuit.

A:
Here's a scenario to play with Cubetto:

**Title:** "The Brave Knight's Rescue Mission"

**Objective:** Help the brave knight (played by a child) rescue the princess (played by a Barbie doll) from the clutches of the evil dragon (played by another child).

**Setup:**

1. Create a simple obstacle course using blocks, books, or other materials to represent the kingdom.
2. Place the princess (Barbie doll) at the end of the obstacle course, making it difficult for the knight to reach her.
3. Assign the evil dragon (another child) to guard the princess and try to stop the knight from rescuing her.

**Cubetto Programming:**

1. Explain to the children that they will use Cubetto to program the brave knight's journey to rescue the princess.
2. Show them how to create a sequence of steps using Cubetto's blocks:
	* Start with the knight's starting point.
	* Add a "move forward" block to make the knight move towards the princess.
	* Add a "turn left" or "turn right" block to navigate around obstacles.
	* Add a "stop" block to pause the knight's journey.
	* Add a "repeat" block to make the knight repeat a sequence of steps.
3. Encourage the children to experiment with different sequences of steps to see how the knight's journey changes.

**Gameplay:**

1. The brave knight (child) will use Cubetto to program their journey to rescue the princess.
2. The evil dragon (another child) will try to stop the knight by moving their own character (e.g., a toy or a block) to block the knight's path.
3. The knight must use their programming skills to outsmart the dragon and reach the princess.
4. If the knight successfully rescues the princess, they win! If the dragon stops the knight, the dragon wins.

**Variations:**

1. Add more challenges, such as a moat or a castle wall, that the knight must navigate around.
2. Introduce a time limit for the knight to rescue the princess, making
