Only three Cubetto command blocks should be used: forward, turn left and turn right. The description should be about half a page long.

## Ahoy, Mateys! Treasure Hunt with Cubetto!

**Objective:** Guide your pirate crew to find the hidden treasure using Cubetto!

**Materials:**

* Cubetto robot
* Cubetto command blocks (forward, turn left, turn right)
* Lego pirate figures
* Lego bricks to build a simple obstacle course (optional)
* Treasure chest (can be a small box decorated like a treasure chest)

**Preparation:**

1. Set up a play area with a designated starting point for the pirates and a hidden treasure chest.
2. (Optional) Build a simple obstacle course using Lego bricks to add an extra challenge.

**Gameplay:**

1. **Storytelling:** Begin by telling the children a pirate story about a lost treasure map and a brave crew searching for it. 
2. **Programming:** Explain to the children that they will be programming Cubetto, the pirate captain, to navigate the course and find the treasure. 
3. **Command Blocks:** Introduce the three command blocks: forward, turn left, and turn right. Demonstrate how each block moves Cubetto in a specific direction.
4. **Treasure Hunt:** Each child will take turns programming Cubetto to find the treasure. They can use the command blocks to create a sequence of movements that will lead Cubetto to the treasure chest. Encourage them to think about the direction they need to move and the turns they need to make.
5. **Collaboration:** Children can work together to program Cubetto, sharing ideas and helping each other.

**Variations:**

* **Obstacle Course:** Add obstacles to the play area to make the treasure hunt more challenging.
* **Multiple Treasures:** Hide multiple treasure chests with different rewards.
* **Pirate Names:** Have the children give their Lego pirate figures names and create a story around them.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* **Problem-solving:** Children will learn to think logically and solve problems by creating a sequence of commands to guide Cubetto.
* **Spatial reasoning:** Children will develop their understanding of directions and spatial relationships.
* **Collaboration:** Children will learn to work together and share
