Only three Cubetto command blocks should be used: forward, turn left and turn right. The description should be about half a page long.

Title: **Pirate Adventure with Cubetto: The Quest for the Treasure**

**Objective:**
Embark on a thrilling journey with your preschoolers as they navigate their Cubetto robot through a pirate-themed adventure. Using just three basic commands—forward, turn left, and turn right—your little explorers will guide Cubetto to discover a hidden treasure, all while engaging with their imaginative play using Lego figures.

**Setting the Scene:**
Transform your classroom into a vibrant pirate cove. Arrange the Cubetto play area to resemble a sun-drenched island, complete with a sandy beach, a small pirate ship, and a treasure chest. Scatter Lego pirate figures around the island, each with a distinct role: the captain, first mate, parrot, and crew members. The treasure chest is placed at the end of a winding path, guarded by a friendly sea creature made from a large Lego block.

**Gameplay:**

1. **The Setup:**
   - Begin by explaining the story to your students: Cubetto, the brave robot pirate, has received a map leading to the legendary treasure hidden on the island. The map is encoded in a sequence of commands using Cubetto's blocks.
   - Introduce the Lego pirate figures and the treasure chest as key elements of the adventure.

2. **The Commands:**
   - Teach the children the three basic commands: forward (to move Cubetto along the path), turn left (to navigate around obstacles), and turn right (to change direction).
   - Demonstrate how to string these commands together to create a simple program that guides Cubetto from the starting point to the treasure.

3. **The Adventure Begins:**
   - Divide the class into small groups, each with their own Cubetto robot and set of commands.
   - Encourage them to work together to decode the map (a simple sequence of commands you provide) and guide Cubetto to the treasure.
   - As they play, circulate and offer guidance, helping them troubleshoot any challenges they encounter.
