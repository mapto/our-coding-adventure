**Characters:**
- **Captain Redbeard:** A brave and adventurous pirate with a red beard and a wide-brimmed hat.
- **First Mate Lily:** A clever and resourceful girl with a map in hand.
- **The Crew:** A group of Lego pirate figures, each with their own unique features.

**Objective:**
The children must guide Cubetto the robot to find the treasure hidden on the island using only three commands: forward, turn left, and turn right.
