## The Great Saloon Rescue!

**Story:**

Barbie and her friends are having a rootin' tootin' time at the Wild West saloon! Suddenly, a tumbleweed rolls in, carrying a note: "Help! Sheriff Barbie is trapped in the jailhouse!"  

**Mission:**

You are brave cowboys and cowgirls! Use Cubetto to rescue Sheriff Barbie from the jailhouse.

**The Map:**

Imagine the saloon as a square. 

* **Start:** Cubetto begins at the saloon entrance.
* **Jailhouse:**  A small square in the middle of the saloon.
* **Sheriff Barbie:**  Inside the jailhouse.

**The Commands:**

You have three special commands to help Cubetto:

* **Forward:**  Cubetto moves one step forward.
* **Turn Left:** Cubetto turns 90 degrees to the left.
* **Turn Right:** Cubetto turns 90 degrees to the right.

**The Challenge:**

Can you program Cubetto to:

1. **Reach the jailhouse door.**
2. **Open the jailhouse door (pretend!).**
3. **Pick up Sheriff Barbie.**
4. **Bring Sheriff Barbie back to the saloon entrance.**

**Tips:**

* Think carefully about the direction Cubetto needs to go.
* Use the "Turn Left" and "Turn Right" commands to change Cubetto's direction.
* Practice your program before you try to rescue Sheriff Barbie!

**Have fun and save the day!**
