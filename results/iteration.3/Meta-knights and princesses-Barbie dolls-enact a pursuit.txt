**Setup:**

1. Place the Cubetto on the floor, and set up a simple obstacle course with blocks, books, or other objects to create a medieval landscape.
2. Place the princess (Barbie doll) in a "captive" location, such as a small castle or a designated "prison" area.
3. The evil dragon (played by a child) will be hiding nearby, waiting to pounce on the princess.

**Gameplay:**

1. The brave knight (played by a child) will use the Cubetto to navigate through the obstacle course and reach the princess.
2. The evil dragon (played by a child) will try to chase the knight and prevent the rescue.
3. The knight must use the Cubetto's command blocks to evade the dragon and reach the princess.
4. The three Cubetto command blocks are:
	* **Forward**: Move the Cubetto one step forward.
	* **Turn Left**: Turn the Cubetto 90 degrees to the left.
	* **Turn Right**: Turn the Cubetto 90 degrees to the right.
5. The knight must use these command blocks to create a path to the princess while avoiding the dragon's attacks.

**Challenges:**

1. The dragon can move around the obstacle course, trying to block the knight's path.
2. The knight must use the Cubetto's command blocks to create a safe path to the princess.
3. If the knight reaches the princess, they win! If the dragon catches the knight, the game starts over.
