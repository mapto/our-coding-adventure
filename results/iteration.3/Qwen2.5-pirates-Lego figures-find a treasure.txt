### Pirate Treasure Hunt Adventure with Cubetto

**Objective:** Guide Cubetto, the wooden robot, to find the hidden treasure on a pirate-themed map using only three command blocks: forward, turn left, and turn right.

**Materials:**
- Cubetto toy
- Map with a pirate-themed layout (drawn on a large piece of paper or printed from a template)
- Lego figures (pirates, treasure chest, etc.)
- Colored markers or stickers (optional, for marking the treasure)

**Setup:**
1. Place Cubetto at the starting point on the map.
2. Arrange Lego figures to create a pirate-themed scene, including a treasure chest that will be the final destination.
3. Explain the story to the children: "Cubetto is a brave pirate ship, and we need to help him find the treasure!"

**Instructions:**
1. **Introduction:**
   - Introduce the concept of programming to the children by explaining that Cubetto will follow instructions to move and turn.
   - Show them the three command blocks: forward, turn left, and turn right.

2. **Exploration:**
   - Place Cubetto at the starting point on the map.
   - Ask the children to think about where they want Cubetto to go to find the treasure.
   - Encourage them to use the command blocks to create a path for Cubetto.

3. **Guided Play:**
   - Start with simple paths, such as:
     - "Let's make Cubetto move forward three times, then turn right, then move forward two times, and finally turn left."
   - As the children get comfortable, introduce more complex paths, like:
     - "Can you make Cubetto move forward, then turn left, then move forward, then turn right, and finally move forward again?"

4. **Treasure Hunt:**
   - Once the children have created a path, guide them to place the Lego treasure chest at the end of the path.
   - Encourage them to check if Cubetto can find the treasure by following the path they created.
