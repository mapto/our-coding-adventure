**Superhero Rescue Mission with Cubetto and Hot Wheels**

**Objective:** To create a fun and interactive game that encourages preschool children to use problem-solving skills and critical thinking while learning the basics of programming with Cubetto.

**Game Description:**

In this exciting game, children will become superheroes tasked with rescuing their friends from the clutches of the evil villain, "The Blocker." The Blocker has set up a series of obstacles using Hot Wheels cars and blocks, and it's up to our young superheroes to navigate through the challenges and reach their friends.

**Gameplay:**

1. Set up the game area with a series of Hot Wheels cars and blocks to create a challenging obstacle course.
2. Divide the children into teams of 2-3 superheroes.
3. Each team will receive a Cubetto robot and a set of command blocks (forward, turn left, and turn right).
4. The objective is for the superheroes to program their Cubetto to navigate through the obstacle course and reach their friends, who are trapped behind the Hot Wheels cars.
5. However, The Blocker has set up a series of challenges to hinder the superheroes' progress. For example, a Hot Wheels car might be placed on a steep incline, or a block might be used to block the Cubetto's path.
6. The superheroes must use their problem-solving skills and critical thinking to program their Cubetto to overcome these challenges.
7. The team that successfully rescues their friends and reaches the final destination wins.

**Cubetto Command Blocks:**

* **Forward:** Move the Cubetto forward one block.
* **Turn Left:** Turn the Cubetto left by 90 degrees.
