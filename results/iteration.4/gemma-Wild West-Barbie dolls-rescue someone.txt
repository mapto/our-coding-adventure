##  Barbie's Wild West Rescue!

**Get ready for a rootin' tootin' adventure with Barbie and Cubetto!**

The Wild West is in trouble!  Barbie's trusty horse, Buttercup, has wandered off and gotten stuck in a prickly cactus patch.  She needs your help to get back to the ranch!

**Here's what you'll need:**

* Your Cubetto robot
* Your Cubetto command blocks: Forward, Turn Left, Turn Right
* Your favorite Barbie doll
* A large play mat or open space

**The Mission:**

Use Cubetto to guide Barbie to Buttercup and rescue her from the cactus patch!

**The Cactus Patch:**

Draw a large cactus patch on your play mat using markers or tape.  Place Barbie doll near the edge of the cactus patch.  

**The Ranch:**

Designate a spot on your play mat as the ranch.  Place Buttercup the horse near the ranch.

**Cubetto's Commands:**

* **Forward:**  Cubetto will move forward one step.
* **Turn Left:** Cubetto will turn 90 degrees to the left.
* **Turn Right:** Cubetto will turn 90 degrees to the right.

**The Challenge:**

Can you program Cubetto to navigate through the cactus patch and reach Buttercup?  Remember, you can only use the Forward, Turn Left, and Turn Right commands!

**Tips:**

* Think carefully about the direction Cubetto needs to go.
* Use the command blocks to create a path for Cubetto to follow.
* Practice your programming skills by trying different combinations of commands.

**Have fun rescuing Barbie and Buttercup!**
