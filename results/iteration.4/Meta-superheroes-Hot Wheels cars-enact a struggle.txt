**Superhero Rescue Mission**

**Age Group:** Preschool Children (3-5 years)

**Objective:** Help the superheroes rescue the city from the evil villain's Hot Wheels cars by using the Cubetto tangible programming toy.

**Storyline:** The city is in chaos as the evil villain's Hot Wheels cars are causing trouble. The superheroes need your help to stop them. You will use the Cubetto to program a brave superhero to navigate through the city and rescue the Hot Wheels cars.

**Gameplay:**

1. Set up the city with blocks and obstacles for the superhero to navigate.
2. Place the Hot Wheels cars in different locations around the city, representing the evil villain's minions.
3. Give each child a Cubetto and a superhero figure.
4. Explain the three Cubetto command blocks: forward, turn left, and turn right.
5. Challenge the children to program their superhero to reach the Hot Wheels cars and rescue them.

**Example Program:**

To rescue a Hot Wheels car stuck in a narrow alley, a child might program their Cubetto as follows:

1. Forward (move the superhero to the alley)
2. Turn left (turn the superhero to face the Hot Wheels car)
3. Forward (move the superhero to the Hot Wheels car)
4. Turn right (turn the superhero to face the exit)
5. Forward (move the superhero out of the alley)

**Variations:**

* Add more Hot Wheels cars with different challenges, such as navigating through a maze or avoiding obstacles.
* Introduce new Cubetto command blocks, such as "wait" or "repeat," to increase the complexity of the program.
* Encourage children to work in teams to create a more complex rescue mission.
* Use the Cubetto to program other superheroes with different abilities, such as flying or super strength.

**Assessment:**

* Observe children's ability to understand and use the Cubetto command blocks.
* Evaluate their problem-solving skills as they navigate the city and rescue the Hot Wheels cars.
* Assess their ability to think critically and make adjustments to
