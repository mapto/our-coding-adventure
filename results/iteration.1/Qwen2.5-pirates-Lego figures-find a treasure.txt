### Scenario: The Great Pirate Treasure Hunt

#### Setting:
Imagine a vast, mysterious island filled with hidden treasures and traps. The children are part of a pirate crew, and their mission is to find the legendary treasure of Captain Blackbeard.

#### Materials:
- Cubetto the wooden robot
- A set of Cubetto blocks (directional blocks: forward, backward, left, right, and a few special blocks for loops and conditions)
- Lego figures (pirates, treasure chest, island map, etc.)
- A large play mat or a flat surface to represent the island
- A treasure map (a simple grid with clues)
- Small Lego pieces or other treasures to represent the treasure

#### Instructions:
1. **Setup the Island:**

3. **The Quest Begins:**
   - Explain to the children that they are on a quest to find the treasure of Captain Blackbeard.

   - For example, the first clue might say, "Move forward three steps, then turn left and move forward two steps."

4. **Using Cubetto:**

   - They can place the blocks in a sequence to tell Cubetto where to go.
   - For example, if the clue is "Move forward three steps, then turn left and move forward two steps," they
