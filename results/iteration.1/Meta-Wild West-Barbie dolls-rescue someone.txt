**Story:** In the Wild West town of "Dusty Valley," a notorious outlaw named "Blackheart Bill" has kidnapped the town's beloved sheriff, played by a Barbie doll. The sheriff's daughter, also a Barbie doll, has called upon the brave children of the town to rescue her father. The children have heard about the magical Cubetto, a mysterious inventor who has created a machine that can help them navigate through the Wild West terrain and reach Blackheart Bill's hideout.

**Objective:** Using Cubetto, the children must program a path for their brave cowboy or cowgirl character to reach Blackheart Bill's hideout, rescue the sheriff, and return to the town of Dusty Valley.

3. Introduce the Cubetto machine, which can be placed near the terrain.
4. Provide the children with a set of Cubetto blocks, including:
	* A cowboy or cowgirl character block
	* A horse block
	* A wagon block
	* A bridge block
	* A tunnel block
	* A "danger" block (e.g., a cactus or a snake)

**Gameplay:**

1. The children will use the Cubetto blocks to program a path for their cowboy or cowgirl character to reach the hideout.
2. They will need to navigate through the terrain, avoiding obstacles and dangers along the way.
3. When the character reaches the hideout, the children will need to program a sequence of actions to rescue the sheriff, such as:
	* Moving the character to the hideout
	* Using the horse block to reach the hideout
	* Using the wagon block to transport the sheriff back to the town
4. Once the sheriff is rescued, the children will need to program a path to return to
