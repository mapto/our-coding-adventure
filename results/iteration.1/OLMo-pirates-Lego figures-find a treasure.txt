Q: Suggest a scenario to play with the Cubetto tangible programming toy. It should be about pirates, involve Lego figures and children should use Cubetto to find a treasure.

A:
**Title: The Pirate Adventure with Cubetto**

**Scenario Setup:**

* **Setting:** A sun-drenched tropical island, complete with palm trees, a sandy beach, and a small cove. The island is home to a hidden treasure guarded by a mischievous pirate crew.

* **Characters:**
  - **Cubetto:** The brave robot explorer.
  - **Captain Redbeard:** The pirate captain who knows the secret map to the treasure.
  - **First Mate:** A loyal Lego pirate figure who assists Cubetto.
  - **The Crew:** A group of Lego pirate figures, each with a unique personality and role (sailor, cook, lookout, etc.).
  - **The Treasure Map:** A torn-up paper map with pieces scattered around the island.

* **Objective:** Cubetto must navigate through the island, following the clues from the torn map to find all the pieces and then assemble them to reveal the exact location of the treasure.

**How to Play:**

1. **Preparation:**
   - Scatter the torn pieces of the treasure map around the play area.
   - Place Cubetto and the Lego pirate figures at the beach entrance.
   - Set up obstacles and challenges (like a small hill, a river, or a dense forest) that Cubetto must navigate to find the map pieces.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - **Cubetto's Mission:** The children control Cubetto to explore the island. Each piece of the map reveals a clue about the next location where another piece can be found.
   - **Obstacles:** Use the Cubetto's programming blocks to navigate around or over obstacles. For example, use a "turn right" block to avoid a tree or a "move forward" block to cross a river.
   - **Pirate Help:** The First Mate can be programmed to interact with Cubetto. For instance, if Cubetto reaches a pirate, the First Mate can give a clue or a piece of the map.
   - **Pirate Challenges:** Some pirates might challenge Cubetto to a simple task (like a mini-game) before giving a map piece.
