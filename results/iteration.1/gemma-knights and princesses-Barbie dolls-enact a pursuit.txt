Q: Suggest a scenario to play with the Cubetto tangible programming toy. It should be about knights and princesses, involve Barbie dolls and children should use Cubetto to enact a pursuit.

A:
## The Knight's Quest: A Cubetto Adventure

**Scenario:**

Princess Sparkle has been kidnapped by the evil dragon, Sparky! Brave Knight Sir Cubetto must rescue her from Sparky's lair.  

**Materials:**

* Cubetto robot
* Cubetto board
* Cubetto blocks
* Barbie dolls: Princess Sparkle, Sir Cubetto (dressed as a knight), Sparky the dragon
* Optional: Other toys like castles, trees, or obstacles

**Instructions:**

1. **Set the Stage:** Create a world for the story using the toys. Build a castle for Princess Sparkle, a lair for Sparky, and a path for Sir Cubetto to follow.

2. **The Kidnapping:** Tell the children that Princess Sparkle has been kidnapped by Sparky. Place Princess Sparkle in Sparky's lair.

3. **Sir Cubetto's Mission:** Explain that Sir Cubetto must bravely navigate the path to rescue Princess Sparkle.

4. **Programming the Rescue:** Children use Cubetto blocks to program Sir Cubetto's movements:

   * **Forward:**  Sir Cubetto must move forward along the path to reach Sparky's lair.
   * **Turn:** Sir Cubetto might need to turn left or right to avoid obstacles or find the right path.
   * **Repeat:**  If the path is long, children can use the "repeat" block to make Sir Cubetto move the same sequence of actions multiple times.

5. **The Rescue:** Once programmed, children run the program and watch Sir Cubetto bravely navigate the path to Sparky's lair.

6. **Confronting Sparky:**  When Sir Cubetto reaches Sparky's lair, children can act out the confrontation.  Sir Cubetto can "defeat" Sparky by simply reaching Princess Sparkle.

7. **Happy Ending:**  Sir Cubetto rescues Princess Sparkle and they return to the castle, celebrating their victory!

**Variations:**

* **Obstacles:** Add obstacles to the path, requiring Sir Cubetto to navigate around them.
* **Treasure Hunt:** Hide a treasure (a small toy) in Sparky's lair and have Sir Cubetto find it.
* **Multiple Knights:** Use multiple
