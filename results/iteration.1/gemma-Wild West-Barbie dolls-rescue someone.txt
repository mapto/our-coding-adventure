Q: Suggest a scenario to play with the Cubetto tangible programming toy. It should be about Wild West, involve Barbie dolls and children should use Cubetto to rescue someone.

A:
## The Great Saloon Showdown

**Scenario:**

Barbie and her friends are having a rootin' tootin' time at the Wild West saloon. Suddenly, a notorious outlaw, "Quickdraw" Jack, bursts in and kidnaps Barbie's best friend, "Daisy" the cowgirl!  

**The Mission:**

The children must use Cubetto to rescue Daisy from Quickdraw Jack's hideout before he rides off into the sunset!

**The Setup:**

* **The Saloon:** Use building blocks or furniture to create a saloon scene. 
* **Barbie and Daisy:** Place Barbie and a Daisy doll in the saloon.
* **Quickdraw Jack:**  Use a toy cowboy or bandit figure to represent Quickdraw Jack.
* **The Hideout:** Designate a separate area as Quickdraw Jack's hideout, perhaps behind a curtain or under a table.

**The Challenge:**

* **Program Cubetto:** Children will need to program Cubetto to navigate the saloon, avoid obstacles (like saloon tables and chairs), and reach Quickdraw Jack's hideout.
* **Rescue Daisy:** Once Cubetto reaches the hideout, children can program it to pick up Daisy and bring her back to Barbie.

**Adding Complexity:**

* **Obstacles:** Add more obstacles to the saloon, like swinging saloon doors or a "no-entry" sign.
* **Time Limit:** Set a timer to add urgency to the rescue mission.
* **Multiple Characters:** Introduce other characters like a sheriff or a saloon owner who can help or hinder the rescue.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* **Spatial Reasoning:** Children will learn to think about the layout of the environment and plan Cubetto's movements.
* **Problem Solving:** Children will need to figure out how to overcome obstacles and reach their goal.
* **Sequencing:** Children will learn to sequence commands to create a series of actions for Cubetto to follow.
* **Collaboration:** Children can work together to program Cubetto and complete the mission.


This scenario provides a fun and engaging way for children to learn about programming while exploring a Wild West theme.
