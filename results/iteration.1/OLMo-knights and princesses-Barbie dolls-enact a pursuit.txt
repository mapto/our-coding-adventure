  - **The Princess:** Another Barbie doll adorned in a flowing gown, symbolizing the princess in distress.
  - **The Evil Sorcerer:** A small, plush toy dragon or another villainous character, embodying the obstacle in the knight's path.
  - **The Wise Wizard:** A third Barbie doll dressed in a wizard's robe, offering guidance and magic.
  - **The Kingdom:** A setup using Cubetto blocks to create a castle or fortress where the princess is held captive.

* **Objective:**
  The knight must navigate through a maze (constructed with Cubetto blocks) to reach the princess, who is trapped in the castle. The evil sorcerer (the plush toy) is guarding the entrance, and the wise wizard provides clues and magic (represented by specific Cubetto commands) to help the knight overcome obstacles.
