A:
**Scenario: "The Brave Knight's Rescue Mission"**

**Objective:** Help the brave knight, Sir Cubetto, rescue the beautiful Princess Barbie from the clutches of the evil dragon, using the Cubetto tangible programming toy.

**Storyline:** The kingdom is in chaos. The evil dragon has kidnapped Princess Barbie, and the brave knight, Sir Cubetto, has been tasked with rescuing her. The princess is being held in a dark castle, surrounded by the dragon's minions. Sir Cubetto must navigate through the kingdom, avoiding obstacles and collecting helpful items to reach the princess before it's too late.

**Setup:**

1. Create a kingdom terrain using cardboard boxes, paper, or other materials. Set up a dark castle in the center, where the princess is being held.
2. Place the Barbie doll in the castle, representing the princess.
3. Set up obstacles, such as cardboard boxes or paper obstacles, to block Sir Cubetto's path.
4. Place helpful items, such as a sword or a shield, near the kingdom terrain to aid Sir Cubetto in his quest.

**Cubetto Programming:**

1. Children will use the Cubetto blocks to create a program that will guide Sir Cubetto through the kingdom.
2. The program should include:
	* Moving Sir Cubetto to the kingdom terrain.
	* Collecting the sword and shield to aid in the rescue mission.
	* Navigating through obstacles to reach the castle.
	* Rescuing the princess (Barbie doll) from the castle.
3. Children can experiment with different programs to see how they affect the outcome of the rescue mission.

**Challenges and Extensions:**

1. Add more obstacles or challenges, such as a moat or a maze, to make the rescue mission more difficult.
2. Introduce new characters, such as a wise old wizard or a mischievous imp, to aid or hinder Sir Cubetto's progress.
3. Have children work in teams to create a program that will rescue the princess together.
4. Encourage children to think creatively and come up with their own scenarios and challenges for Sir Cubetto.
