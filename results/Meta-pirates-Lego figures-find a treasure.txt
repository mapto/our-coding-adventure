Suggest to a teacher a game with the Cubetto tangible programming toy for preschool children. It should be about pirates, involve Lego figures and children should use Cubetto to find a treasure. Only three Cubetto command blocks should be used: forward, turn left and turn right. The description should be about half a page long.

**Treasure Hunt Adventure with Cubetto**

**Objective:** Help the pirates find the hidden treasure using Cubetto's simple programming commands.

**Materials:**

* Cubetto programming toy
* Lego pirate figures
* A treasure chest (or a small box)
* A pirate-themed obstacle course (e.g., a small island, a bridge, or a cave)

**Instructions:**

1. Set up the pirate-themed obstacle course in the classroom or play area. Place the treasure chest at the end of the course.
2. Introduce the Cubetto programming toy and explain that the children will use it to help the pirates find the treasure.
3. Demonstrate how to use the Cubetto command blocks: forward, turn left, and turn right. Explain that the children will need to program the Cubetto to navigate through the obstacle course to reach the treasure.
4. Divide the children into small groups and give each group a Lego pirate figure. Explain that they will need to work together to program the Cubetto to find the treasure.
5. Challenge the children to program the Cubetto to reach the treasure using the three command blocks: forward, turn left, and turn right. Encourage them to experiment and try different combinations of commands.
6. As the children program the Cubetto, ask them to describe their plan and explain why they chose a particular sequence of commands.
7. Once the Cubetto reaches the treasure, congratulate the children on their success and ask them to reflect on what they learned about programming and problem-solving.

**Variations:**

* To make it more challenging, add obstacles or "pirate traps" that the Cubetto needs to avoid.
* Encourage the children to create their own pirate-themed obstacle course and challenge their peers to find the treasure.
* Use the Cubetto to create a pirate-themed story, where the children take turns programming the Cubetto to navigate through a series of challenges and obstacles.

**Assessment:**

* Observe the children's ability to use the Cubetto command blocks to solve a problem
