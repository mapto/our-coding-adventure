Suggest to a teacher a game with the Cubetto tangible programming toy for preschool children. It should be about Wild West, involve Brio trains and children should use Cubetto to rescue someone. Only three Cubetto command blocks should be used: forward, turn left and turn right. The description should be about half a page long.

**Wild West Rescue Mission**

**Objective:** Help the brave Cubetto cowboy rescue the lost cowgirl from the Wild West town.

**Materials:**

* Cubetto programming toy
* Brio trains and tracks
* Wild West themed props (e.g., cowboy hats, bandannas, cacti)
* A small toy cowgirl figure

**Setup:**

1. Create a Wild West town using Brio tracks and props. Set up a small town with a main street, a saloon, and a sheriff's office.
2. Place the toy cowgirl figure in a hard-to-reach location, such as a high platform or a small cave.
3. Explain to the children that the cowgirl is in trouble and needs to be rescued.

**Gameplay:**

1. Give each child a Cubetto programming toy and explain the three basic commands: forward, turn left, and turn right.
2. Challenge the children to program their Cubetto cowboy to reach the cowgirl using the three basic commands.
3. Encourage the children to think creatively and use problem-solving skills to overcome obstacles, such as navigating through the Brio tracks or avoiding "bandits" (other toys or props).
4. As the children program their Cubetto, ask them to describe their plan and explain why they chose a particular sequence of commands.
5. Once the children have successfully rescued the cowgirl, ask them to reflect on their process and discuss what they learned about problem-solving and programming.

**Variations:**

* To add an extra level of challenge, you can introduce "bandits" or "obstacles" that the Cubetto cowboy must avoid or overcome.
* Encourage the children to create their own Wild West-themed props and incorporate them into the game.
* Consider setting up a time limit or a series of challenges for the children to complete, such as rescuing the cowgirl from different locations or navigating through a maze.

**Assessment:**

* Observe the children's problem-solving skills and ability to think
