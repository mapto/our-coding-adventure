 Title: "Knightly Pursuit with Cubetto and Barbie"

Description:
In this imaginative game, preschool children will embark on a thrilling knightly pursuit using Cubetto, Barbie dolls, and a magical castle setting. The objective is for the knight (Cubetto) to chase the princess (Barbie) around the castle.

1. Set up the castle using blocks, ramps, and tunnels. Place the princess (Barbie) in a hidden location within the castle.

2. Program Cubetto with three simple commands:
   - Forward: To move Cubetto towards the princess.
   - Turn Left: To navigate around obstacles and corners within the castle.
   - Turn Right: To change direction when the princess is out of reach or when Cubetto is cornered.

3. Encourage children to predict the path Cubetto will take based on the commands given and discuss strategies for the knight to catch the princess.

4. After each attempt, discuss what worked and what didn't, and adjust the commands or castle layout accordingly. This will help children develop problem-solving skills and understand the basics of programming logic.

5. Once the knight catches the princess, celebrate the victory and reset the game for another round of pursuit. This game fosters creativity, collaboration, and early coding skills in a fun and engaging way.
