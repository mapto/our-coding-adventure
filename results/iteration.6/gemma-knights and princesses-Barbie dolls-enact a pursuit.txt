##  The Knight's Quest!

**Objective:** Help the brave knight rescue the princess from the dragon!

**Materials:**

* Cubetto robot
* Cubetto command blocks (forward, turn left, turn right)
* Barbie dolls: a knight, a princess, and a dragon
* Play mat or large sheet of paper

**Instructions:**

1. **Set the scene:** Arrange the Barbie dolls on the play mat. The princess is trapped in a tower (a designated area), and the dragon guards her. The knight starts at a distance.

2. **Program the knight:**  Children work together to program Cubetto to navigate the play mat. They use the forward, turn left, and turn right blocks to guide the knight towards the princess.

3. **The pursuit:**  As Cubetto moves, children narrate the story.  "The knight bravely marches forward!" "He turns left to avoid the dragon's fire!" "He's getting closer to the princess!"

4. **Rescue mission:** When Cubetto reaches the princess, the children cheer! The knight has successfully rescued the princess!

**Variations:**

* **Obstacle course:** Add obstacles (blocks, toys) for Cubetto to navigate around.
* **Multiple knights:** Use multiple Cubetto robots for different knights to rescue the princess.
* **Dragon chase:** Program the dragon to move around the play mat, making it harder for the knight to reach the princess.


This game encourages teamwork, problem-solving, and storytelling while introducing basic programming concepts in a fun and engaging way.
