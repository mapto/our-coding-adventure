It should be about pirates, involve Lego figures and children should use Cubetto to find a treasure. Only three Cubetto command blocks should be used: forward, turn left and turn right. The description should be less than 2000 characters excluding spaces.

-------------------
**Treasure Hunt Adventure with Cubetto**

**Objective:** Help the pirate find the hidden treasure using Cubetto commands.

**Materials:**

* Cubetto programming toy
* Lego pirate figures
* A treasure chest (or a small box)
* A simple obstacle course (e.g., a few blocks or cones)

**Instructions:**

1. Set up the obstacle course and place the treasure chest at the end.
2. Give each child a Lego pirate figure and a Cubetto.
3. Explain that the pirate needs to find the treasure using Cubetto commands.
4. Demonstrate how to use the three Cubetto command blocks: forward, turn left, and turn right.
5. Challenge the children to create a sequence of commands to help the pirate navigate through the obstacle course and reach the treasure.
6. Encourage them to experiment and try different paths.
7. As they play, ask questions like: "What would happen if the pirate turns left?" or "How can the pirate avoid the obstacle?"

**Variations:**

* Add a "map" with a simple grid to help the children plan their route.
* Introduce a "storm" obstacle that requires the pirate to use a specific command to avoid it.
* Have the children work in pairs or small groups to create a more complex treasure hunt.

**Assessment:**

* Observe the children's problem-solving skills and ability to think critically.
* Ask questions to assess their understanding of the Cubetto commands and the pirate's journey.
* Evaluate their ability to create a sequence of commands to achieve a goal.

This game is designed to be fun and engaging while introducing preschool children to the basics of programming and problem-solving using Cubetto.
