It should be about superheroes, involve Hot Wheels cars and children should use Cubetto to enact a struggle. Only three Cubetto command blocks should be used: forward, turn left and turn right. The description should be less than 2000 characters excluding spaces.

## Superhero Rescue Mission!

**Objective:** Help your superhero car save the day!

**Materials:**

* Cubetto robot
* Cubetto command blocks (forward, turn left, turn right)
* Hot Wheels cars (one for each child)
* Imaginary villains and obstacles!

**Instructions:**

1. **Set the scene:**  Each child chooses a superhero car and imagines a villain has trapped a helpless citizen (another Hot Wheels car). 
2. **Program the rescue:** Using only forward, turn left, and turn right blocks, children program Cubetto to navigate their superhero car to the trapped citizen. 
3. **Obstacle course:**  Create a simple obstacle course with blocks or toys. Children must program Cubetto to avoid obstacles and reach the trapped citizen.
4. **Superhero showdown:**  Once Cubetto reaches the trapped citizen, children can act out the superhero rescuing the citizen!

**Extension:**

*  Challenge children to program Cubetto to collect other "rescued" cars along the way.
*  Introduce new command blocks like "repeat" to create more complex rescue missions.


This game encourages spatial reasoning, problem-solving, and creative storytelling while introducing basic programming concepts in a fun and engaging way.
