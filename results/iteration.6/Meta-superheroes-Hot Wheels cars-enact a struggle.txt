Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF	Suggest to a teacher a game with the Cubetto tangible programming toy for preschool children. It should be about superheroes, involve Hot Wheels cars and children should use Cubetto to enact a struggle. Only three Cubetto command blocks should be used: forward, turn left and turn right. The description should be less than 2000 characters excluding spaces.

-------------------
**Superhero Rescue Mission**

**Objective:** Help the superhero rescue the trapped civilians from the villain's lair using Hot Wheels cars and Cubetto.

**Setup:**

1. Create a simple track using Hot Wheels cars for the superhero to navigate.
2. Place the Cubetto at the starting point of the track.
3. Set up the villain's lair at the end of the track with a few civilians trapped inside.

**Gameplay:**

1. Explain to the children that they will use Cubetto to control the superhero's movements.
2. Introduce the three Cubetto command blocks: forward, turn left, and turn right.
3. Demonstrate how to use the blocks to navigate the superhero through the track.
4. Challenge the children to create a sequence of Cubetto blocks to help the superhero reach the civilians.
5. As the children enact their sequence, ask them to describe what's happening in the story (e.g., "The superhero is driving forward to reach the civilians!").
6. To add a challenge, introduce obstacles like rocks or tunnels that the superhero must navigate around.
7. Encourage the children to experiment with different sequences and try again if they fail.

**Struggle Enactment:**

To enact a struggle, you can introduce a villain character (e.g., a cardboard box) that the superhero must overcome. For example:

* The villain is blocking the superhero's path, and the children must use Cubetto to create a sequence to move the superhero around the villain.
* The villain is trying to steal the civilians, and the children must use Cubetto to create a sequence to chase the villain and rescue the civilians.

This game encourages problem-solving, creativity, and critical thinking while introducing preschool children to the basics of programming with Cubetto.
