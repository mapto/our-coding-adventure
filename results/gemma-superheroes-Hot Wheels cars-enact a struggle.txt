Suggest to a teacher a game with the Cubetto tangible programming toy for preschool children. It should be about superheroes, involve Hot Wheels cars and children should use Cubetto to enact a struggle. Only three Cubetto command blocks should be used: forward, turn left and turn right. The description should be about half a page long.

## Superhero Training: The Hot Wheels Rescue Mission!

This game combines Cubetto's tangible programming with imaginative play, encouraging preschoolers to think spatially and creatively while exploring the world of superheroes.

**Materials:**

* Cubetto robot
* Cubetto command blocks (forward, turn left, turn right)
* Hot Wheels cars (at least two, one for the superhero and one for the "villain")
* A play mat or large sheet of paper to represent the city

**Story:**

Our superhero needs to rescue a citizen from the clutches of a villain! The villain has trapped the citizen in a building (represented by a box or a drawn shape on the play mat). The superhero must navigate the city, avoiding obstacles (represented by toys or drawn shapes), and reach the building to save the day!

**Gameplay:**

1. **Set the scene:** Lay out the play mat and arrange the Hot Wheels cars. The superhero car should start at a designated point, while the villain car is placed near the "building."

2. **Program the superhero:** Children work together to program Cubetto to guide the superhero car to the "building." They can use the forward, turn left, and turn right command blocks to create a path for the superhero. Encourage them to think about the direction they need to go and how many steps are needed to reach the building.

3. **Obstacle course:** Add obstacles to the play mat, such as toy blocks or drawn lines. Children can adjust Cubetto's program to navigate around these obstacles, making the rescue mission more challenging.

4. **The rescue:** Once Cubetto reaches the "building," the superhero car can "rescue" the citizen car. Celebrate the successful mission!

**Variations:**

* **Different villains:** Use different Hot Wheels cars to represent different villains with unique abilities.
* **Multiple rescues:** Create multiple buildings with trapped citizens and have children program Cubetto to rescue them all.
* **Teamwork:** Divide the children into teams, each responsible for programming a different superhero to complete a specific rescue mission.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* **Spatial reasoning:**
