Suggest to a teacher a game with the Cubetto tangible programming toy for preschool children. It should be about Wild West, involve Brio trains and children should use Cubetto to rescue someone. Only three Cubetto command blocks should be used: forward, turn left and turn right. The description should be about half a page long.

Certainly! Here’s a fun and engaging game idea for preschool children using the Cubetto tangible programming toy, themed around a Wild West adventure:

**Wild West Rescue Mission**

In this exciting game, preschool children will embark on a Wild West adventure to rescue a friend who has been captured by a bandit. The children will use Cubetto, the wooden robot, to navigate through a series of challenges using only three command blocks: forward, turn left, and turn right.

**Objective:** Guide Cubetto to the rescue location using the given command blocks.

**Setup:** Place Cubetto at the starting point, and set up a simple Wild West-themed track using Brio train tracks. The track should include obstacles like hills, rivers, and bandit hideouts. Place a small figurine or a toy representing the person to be rescued at the end of the track.

**Instructions:**
1. Explain the story to the children: "Cubetto needs to rescue a friend who has been captured by a bandit in the Wild West. We need to guide Cubetto to the rescue location using the command blocks."
2. Show the children the three command blocks: forward, turn left, and turn right.
3. Demonstrate how to place the blocks on Cubetto’s board to create a simple path.
4. Encourage the children to work together to solve the puzzle. They can take turns placing the command blocks and watching Cubetto move.
5. Provide hints if needed, such as asking which direction Cubetto needs to go or how many steps to take.

**Variations:**
- Add more complexity by introducing different colored command blocks with different functions, but keep the main challenge using only the three basic blocks.
- Create different scenarios, such as rescuing a cow from a bandit or delivering a message to a sheriff.

This game not only teaches basic programming concepts but also fosters teamwork, problem-solving skills, and creativity in a fun and engaging Wild West setting.
